I tried to use mods that I felt kept the intended art style of the game or whatever.

Mods used for event screenshots:
- No Model Tinting: https://gamebanana.com/mods/48874 (might not matter)
- Restored GUN Logos: https://gamebanana.com/mods/48914 (might not matter)
- SA2 ESRGAN HD Textures: https://gamebanana.com/mods/48913 (Max Quality)
- Cutscene Revamp: https://gamebanana.com/mods/48872
- Dreamcast Characters: https://gamebanana.com/wips/48797 (I forgot to disable this)
Codes used for level screenshots:
- Disable Subtitles
- Enable Cutscene Debug Features

I have no way to accurately recreate screenshots. I just played events and
hoped to take a reasonable screenshot at the right time.

Some events I could not take distinct enough screenshots, so they use the same
screenshot.
Specifically these events use screenshots corresponding to these other events:
  event 126 (rouge vs. knuckles aftermath)   : event  24 (knuckles vs. rouge aftermath)
  event 130 (shadow and sonic's final battle): event  27 (sonic and shadow's final battle)
  event 361 (english sa2b intro)             : event 360 (japanese sa2b intro)
  event 401 (sa2 intro)                      : event 350 (sa2 intro dreamcast)
  event 428 (the eclipse cannon malfunctions): event  28 (hero story ending)
  event 609 (the ark is neutralized)         : event 208 (shadow saves the world)

Perhaps I could have focused on another character, like I did during some of
the character introductions? Welp, I did not.

Event filenames use ids as events do not have an official name, that I know of.

For most events, the crop batch file should be able to quickly crop from
1080p down to the center 1024x1024 using ffmpeg. This REPLACES the file.
Else, manually crop.

There are no screenshots for Gameplay Events, as I can not view these events
manually.
