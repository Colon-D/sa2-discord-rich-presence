It's complicated ðŸ™ƒ. I hate licenses.

My code is under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), apart from under comments stating I have stolen something.

Note that most mods are using GameBanana's default license of [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Anything that does not have a license, I am stealing.
